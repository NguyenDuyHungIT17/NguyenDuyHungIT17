### 🚀 A bit about me

I'm a passionate full-stack developer who thrives on clean architecture and robust backend systems.  
Whether it's building APIs, designing databases, or optimizing performance — I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

I’m currently learning, building, breaking, and fixing things with:

- **Golang** – blazing fast, simple, and my favorite for backend development  
- **Java** – comfortable with Spring Boot, JPA, and secure APIs  
- **C#** – experienced with ASP.NET Core & Entity Framework

---

### 🧰 My Tech Toolbox

- 🔧 **Languages**: Go, Java, C#
- 🛠 **Frameworks**: Go-Zero, Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core  
- 🧱 **Database**: MySQL, SQL Server  
- 🧪 **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Swagger, Postman, VS Code, Visual Studio  
- 🌐 **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)

I’m particularly focused on:

- 🧠 Writing clean, maintainable code  
- 🔐 Building secure, token-based authentication with JWT  
- ⚙️ Designing RESTful APIs with thoughtful architecture

---

### 🧠 Currently into...

- Backend scalability & microservices  
- Building real-world apps using Go + MySQL  
- DevOps basics with Docker & CI/CD

---

### 🎯 Fun facts

- I like football, swimming, and tech books  
- I believe clean code is better than clever code  
- I build to learn, and I learn by building
